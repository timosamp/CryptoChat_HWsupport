This project was created in the context of "Operating Systems Lab" at School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of NTUA. The codes are based on CSlab template.

The aim of this project of this project is the implementation of a cryptographic chat between the host machine and a guest hosted in qemu VM. Additionally, the cryptographic functions are using hardware support (a custome variation of linux's cryptodev module).

The codes here are a small part of the whole project where there was the need for further developing.
